Calculating Cosmological Parameters Using Type IA Supernovae

This project closely follows this paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab04fa#apjlab04fas3-4
From the paper, I used the given data from both Dark Energy Survey, as well as the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics surveys. Everything else has been coded by me.

We first bin the data to account for noise.
We calculate the chi square values of each point compared to different cosmological models, and optimize the cosmological parameters to find a model that best fits the binned data.

It is not a particularly long winded project, nor new, however it does confirm the existence of dark matter, and that dark matter is the main factor causing our universe to expand.
The project is not meant to prove anything new, rather, express my skills and understanding of cosmology.
